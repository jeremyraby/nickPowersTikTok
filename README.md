### Questions & hypotheses

> Some of this I've either read about over the years or have actually seen a TT from Nick about the individual topic.

General thoughts: more "conservative" (based on Trump/Biden votes in 2020) states will have more liberal firearms laws than more "liberal" states but will have worse indicators regarding crime.
