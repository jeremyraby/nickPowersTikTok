### Questions & hypotheses

> Some of this I've either read about over the years or have actually seen a TT from Nick about the individual topic.

General thoughts: more "conservative" (based on Trump/Biden votes in 2020) states will have more liberal firearms laws than more "liberal" states but will have worse indicators regarding crime.

- Do states with higher rates of firearm ownership have rates of violent crime?
  - Read about data sources for relevant fields:
    - size (sq mi)
      - taken thrid-party from US Census
    - population
      - taken from USDA ERS
    - firearm ownership
      - supposedly ultimately comes from Pew. This is also just going to be hard to trust regardless of source because people won't necessarily be truthful on surveys since registration isn't universally required
    - violent crime per 100k
      - from Wikipedia, reported in 2020
